 ## Description

 this is just a simple demonstration that i had developed after an interview
 to sho my coding in reactjs. some part of it maybe look meaningless like 
 ActionCreator func instead of using built-in ActionCreator of Redux toolkit.
 I have used both HOC and hooks to show that I know both !!!!!!!.
 I have used least unit test and no end to end tests but it's enough to show 
 that i can write Unit tests.
